# Maternal and Child Health in East Africa: Data Analysis Project

A data-driven analysis of maternal mortality, child mortality, vaccination coverage, and healthcare financing across six East African countries (2018-2022).

---

## 📊 Overview

This project examines health outcomes and healthcare financing in East Africa to assess progress toward **SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being)**. Through interactive visualizations and evidence-based analysis, it identifies trends, disparities, and policy priorities.

- Under-five mortality rate (per 1,000 live births)
- Vaccination coverage (DPT3, Measles, BCG)
- Current Health Expenditure (CHE) as % of GDP
- Government Health Expenditure (GGHE-D) as % of GDP
